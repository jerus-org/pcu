My tastes in film, TV and books run a wide gamut but if I was to pin it to one genre it would probably be Science Fiction and Fantasy (is that two?). There is something about taking you out of a familiar world that really helps to focus on delivering a particular message. Perhaps it's the fact that everything is strange; anything is possible. It ensures that your brain doesn't assume away some important detail with one of its many heuristics.
