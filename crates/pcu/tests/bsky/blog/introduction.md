## Introduction

The name, ruminations, is intended to set an expectation for an eclectic set of topics. I have a broad set of influences and interests (perhaps not unlike many) and tend more towards the generalist than the specialist. Expect nothing, everything and anything and then I hope not to disappoint!

## What

With broad experience across technology and human experience over the coming years I hope to fill this site with all sorts of ruminations. So may be very practical, demonstrating the use of tools and technologies. Other's may tend towards the philosophical, sociological, political or whatever-al your having. There may even be some poetry.

## Why

The short answer: because I have lots going on in my head and should really put (at least some of) it out there.

The long answer: well, that will take a paragraph or more :) !

The idea has been a long time baking - I secured the domain name over ten years ago. I have wanted to write (if only to improve my writing), but its always been the "last thing". I was encouraged to do so, but still did not take action. Now, I will no longer get that encouragement so I guess its past time to get to doing.
